# Deep Zoom File Explorer

This project is an exploration of deep zooming user interfaces similar
to Google Earth. In the demo it is applied to the file system, but could
be applied to many domains. The idea of deep zoom was inspired by
the Mandelbrot Set, fractal geometry,  and Google Earth.

## Todo

* fix bug where text spills out
* fix performance bug where when panning the interface, the slow iterative
rendering has to restart, causing a wait in the user experience
